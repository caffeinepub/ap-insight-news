# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Sort all news articles in descending order by date so the latest articles appear first throughout the application.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the backend query that returns all articles to sort by date descending (newest first).
- Apply date-descending sort on the frontend for the HomePage, PoliticalNewsPage, and MovieNewsPage article listings.
- Ensure the TopStoriesSidebar and BreakingNewsTicker components also display articles in newest-first order.

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see the most recently dated articles at the top of every article list, sidebar, and ticker across the site.
