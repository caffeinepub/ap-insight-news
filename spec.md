# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Deploy the AP Insight News application (Motoko backend canister and React frontend asset canister) to the Internet Computer mainnet so it is publicly accessible.

**Planned changes:**
- Deploy the backend Motoko canister to the Internet Computer mainnet network.
- Build and deploy the frontend React app as an asset canister to the Internet Computer mainnet network.
- Configure dfx.json and deployment settings as needed for mainnet deployment.

**User-visible outcome:** The AP Insight News application is live and accessible via a public ICP URL (e.g., `https://<canister-id>.icp0.io`), with all existing features including homepage, political news, movie news, article detail, admin page, and Internet Identity authentication working correctly.
