# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the navigation label "MANAGE REVIEWS" to "Movie Reviews" throughout the frontend UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the navigation item label from "MANAGE REVIEWS" to "Movie Reviews" in the Header component (desktop and mobile)
- Update the label from "MANAGE REVIEWS" to "Movie Reviews" in the Footer component if present

**User-visible outcome:** The navigation option previously labeled "MANAGE REVIEWS" now displays as "Movie Reviews" everywhere it appears, while still linking to the same page.
