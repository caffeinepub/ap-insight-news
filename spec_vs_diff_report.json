  "summary": "The diff shows that the Header component has been updated to display 'Movie Reviews' instead of 'MANAGE REVIEWS' for the admin reviews link, covering both desktop and mobile navigation. The file summary for Header.tsx confirms the label change. The Footer component is mentioned in the file summaries but its diff content is not shown — however, the summary describes it as having 'quick links' without explicitly mentioning 'Movie Reviews'. The route path (/admin/reviews) appears unchanged. Overall, REQ-1 appears largely implemented in the Header, but the Footer change cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff.",
