  "summary": "The diff shows only two modified files: backend/main.mo (the Motoko actor code) and project_state.json (metadata update). There is no evidence of deployment configuration — no dfx.json creation/modification, no canister IDs, no deployment scripts, no frontend build configuration updates for mainnet, no asset canister setup, and no ICP-specific network configuration. REQ-16 requires actually deploying to Internet Computer mainnet, which involves configuration and deployment artifacts not present in this diff.",
