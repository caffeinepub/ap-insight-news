  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-1 by fixing the article submission flow on the Admin page. The backend addNews function is properly defined with all required parameters and 7-day expiry logic. The frontend useAddNews hook correctly passes all parameters in the right order with null imageUrl handling. The AdminPage includes form validation with inline error/success messages, actor readiness checks, and query invalidation on success so the new article appears in the list. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",
