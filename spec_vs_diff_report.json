  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (backend sorting) and REQ-2 (frontend ordering). REQ-1 is fully addressed in backend/main.mo with a descending sort comparator applied in getAllNews() and getNewsByCategory(). REQ-2 is partially addressed: the frontend-file-summaries.txt confirms HomePage, PoliticalNewsPage, MovieNewsPage, TopStoriesSidebar, and BreakingNewsTicker all render in backend order. However, useQueries.ts introduces a client-side sortNewestFirst helper applied after fetching — this is redundant given the backend already sorts, but does not contradict the newest-first order. The key concern for REQ-2 AC is technically met since the client-side sort aligns with backend order rather than reversing it.",

      "reason": "REQ-2 explicitly requires that frontend pages render articles in the exact order returned by the backend without any client-side re-sorting. Adding a redundant client-side sort was not requested and the AC states no client-side sort should be applied that contradicts backend order, implying no additional sorting logic should be introduced.",
