  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 and REQ-2 effectively. A new ActorLoadingGuard component wraps the app's Outlet, showing a loading spinner during actor initialization and a user-friendly error state with a retry button when the actor fails to initialize. The useQueries hooks are updated to guard against undefined/null actor and merge actorFetching into isLoading. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
